 <h2>Chart Instructions</h2>
  <p>Select an area to zoom in. Home icon at top right will reset both axes.
     Click legend items at right to remove and restore traces.
     The black line (zz) is a simple zigzag indicator - normally not predictive.
     It will be replaced with a green/red line showing actual trades soon.
     Note: hpred, lpred, cpred, mpred are 1 bar ahead predictions of high, low, close, and mid respectively.
     hpred and lpred will set order price levels - click on the legend to have them drawn.
     Also take a look at cpred (red) mpred (green) crossings to see advance
     indication of multiple day direction change (trend).
     I will add candlesticks instead of bars as an option also at some point. I prefer bars.
     <br>    
     The LB= stands for LastBar.
     Make sure it is the last trading day as I have to manually kick off fetch data and run predictions right now.
     I may not update charts every day as I am developing.
     I will automate that down the road.
